# My first python game

## How to Play:
1. The game starts by generating a random number between 1 and 100.
2. You have up to 7 attempts to guess the number correctly.
3. If you guess incorrectly, you'll get feedback on whether your guess was too high or too low.
4. If you guess correctly within the allowed attempts, you win!
5. If you run out of attempts, the game ends, and you can decide to play again or quit.

## Example:
```python
# Let's say the target number is 87
```
1. You input `50`: The program will tell you that your guess was too low.
2. You input `70`: The program will tell you that your guess was too high.
3. You input `80`: The program will tell you that your guess was too high, but closer.
4. You input `85`: Again, it's too high.
5. On your 7th attempt, if you guess `87`, you'll win!

This is a simple but engaging game that can be easily customized by adjusting the number range and other
parameters in the code.
